Tumor samples used for IHC staining were obtained from 12 GBMs, including six short-term-survival and six long-term-survival patients. 
The surgically removed tumor tissues were stored in formalin immediately after excision and embedded in paraffin within 3 days. 
IHC staining and image capture were performed as previously described (Hu et al.,2018). 
The primary antibody for the detection of macrophage marker MS4A4A was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (HPA029323; St. Louis, MO, USA), with staining was performed according to manufacturer instructions.
